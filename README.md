# mongoDB

A small practice project using MongoDB to support my learning during a database course. I created this project to get a deeper understanding of MongoDB and to better understand the course literature. Anyone can try out this project to practice using MongoDB.

To run this project:

1. Make sure you have MongoDB downloaded and installed. 
2. Download the countries.json package used in this example.
